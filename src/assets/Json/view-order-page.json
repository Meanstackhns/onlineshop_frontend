            "description": "As most of the fat content in a chicken is stored in its skin, our chicken curry cut without the skin is a healthy alternative. A great source of lean, low-fat protein that is bursting with flavour and is ready to fall off the bone as soon as you cook it. Ideal for: An evergreen cut, you can make anything from Chettinadu, Mughlai, Punjabi, Tandoori to Chinese cuisine, with our chicken curry cut. Freshness Indicator: The chicken should be pink in colour and cold to touch. Tip: It is very easy to overcook this cut, leaving it dry and rubbery, so watch like a hawk while you are cooking.",
